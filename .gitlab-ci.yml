# This file is a template, and might need editing before it works on your project.
# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.
#
# For more information, see: https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/README.html#stages

stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - test
#   - deploy

pytest:
  stage: test
  tags: [shell]
  script:
    - pytest -n 10 --junitxml=report.xml
  artifacts:
    when: always
    reports:
      junit: report.xml

# lint-test-job:   # This job also runs in the test stage.
#   stage: test    # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).
#   script:
#     - echo "Linting code... This will take about 10 seconds."
#     - sleep 10
#     - echo "No lint issues found."

# deploy-job:      # This job runs in the deploy stage.
#   stage: deploy  # It only runs when *both* jobs in the test stage complete successfully.
#   script:
#     - echo "Deploying application..."
#     - echo "Application successfully deployed."
